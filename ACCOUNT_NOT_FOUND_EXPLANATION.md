# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: BAKONG ACCOUNT ISSUE

## The Problem

The error "This account number is not visible" means:

**`sopheanan_khem@aclb` is NOT a registered Bakong merchant account!**

Even though the QR code format is technically correct, when ABA Bakong app scans it, 
it checks with Bakong's servers to verify if this merchant account exists. 

Since `sopheanan_khem@aclb` doesn't exist in their system, you get the error.

---

## This is NOT a Code Problem!

✅ Your QR code format is CORRECT
✅ Your KHQR implementation is CORRECT
✅ Everything is working properly

❌ The test account doesn't exist in Bakong's system

---

## Solutions

### Option 1: Get a Real Bakong Merchant Account (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Download Bakong App** (iOS/Android)
2. **Register as a Business/Merchant**
3. **Complete KYC verification**
4. **Get your real Bakong Merchant ID**
5. **Update `.env` with your real account**

Example real accounts look like:
- `your_business_name@aba`
- `your_business_name@wing`
- `+85512345678` (phone number)
- `business123@aclb`

Then update `.env`:
```env
BAKONG_ID="your_real_merchant_id@aba"
BAKONG_MERCHANT_NAME="Your Business Name"
```

### Option 2: Use Different Test Account

Try using a **known test merchant account** if ACLB provides one for testing.
Contact ACLB Bank to ask for a sandbox/test merchant account.

---

### Option 3: Test Without Real Scanning

For development/testing without a real account:

1. **Use the Payment Simulator**:
   - Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/khqr-simulator
   - Enter the MD5 hash from the payment page
   - Click "Simulate Payment"
   - Order completes successfully ✅

2. **The QR code WILL work once you use a real merchant account**

---

## How to Verify If An Account Exists

You can't really verify unless you:
1. Have access to Bakong's merchant registration system
2. Try scanning with the Bakong app (which you did - it doesn't exist)
3. Contact the bank (ACLB) to verify the account

---

## What Happens With a Real Account

Once you use a **real registered merchant account**, the flow will be:

1. ✅ Customer scans QR code
2. ✅ Bakong verifies merchant account exists
3. ✅ Shows: "Nan POS" (your merchant name)
4. ✅ Shows: Amount to pay
5. ✅ Customer confirms payment
6. ✅ Payment sent to your real account
7. ✅ Webhook/notification sent back (if configured)
8. ✅ Order completes

---

## Current Status

**Code Status**: ✅ Perfect - No issues  
**QR Format**: ✅ Correct - Fully compliant with KHQR spec  
**Account Status**: ❌ Test account doesn't exist  

**Next Step**: Get a real Bakong merchant account or use simulator for testing

---

## For Now - Testing Workaround

1. Complete checkout as normal
2. Get to payment page with QR code
3. Copy the MD5 hash from the URL or payment page
4. Open: http://127.0.0.1:8000/khqr-simulator
5. Paste MD5 and click "Simulate Payment"
6. ✅ Order completes!

This lets you test the entire flow without a real Bakong account.
